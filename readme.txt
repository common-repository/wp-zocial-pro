Enables the use of Zocial buttons within WordPress without coding know how. Buttons and/or icons can be inserted via a shortcode using the shortcode generator.

== Description ==

90+ CSS3 @font-face vector icons and buttons
WP Zocial Pro makes it easy to add any or all of the 90+ @font-face vector icons and buttons to your post, pages and anywhere your theme accepts shortcodes.
Comes with a simple yet effective shortcode generator located right on the TinyMCE post/page editor for your convenience - no need to remember those long
shortcodes or fumble around with HTML to get your buttons and icons up.

__Shortcode Option__

Simply click the WP Zocial icon on your post/page editor (its the colourful one), make a couple of selections, enter your target URL, adjust the size to your
requirements and click insert shortcode - simple as 1 2 3 and you are done.

The shortcode will look something like [wpzocial account="youtube" type="default" href="http://youtube.com"]Your Button Text Here[/wpzocial] - Just
remember to change the words "Your Button Text Here" to your own and relevant to the button/icon.

Enjoy!
